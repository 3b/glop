===========

The goal is to provide simple OpenGL window and context manipulation code as well as system
input handling (i.e. mouse & keyboard).

Direct FFI bindings to system functions are used so no third party C lib is required
except system libraries.

 - CFFI

Supported CL implementations/platforms
