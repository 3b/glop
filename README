The goal is to provide simple OpenGL window and context manipulation code as well as system
input handling (i.e. mouse & keyboard).

Direct FFI bindings to system functions are used so no third party C lib is required
except system libraries.

Dependencies:
 - CFFI

Tested on:
 - CLISP/X11
 - CLISP/Win32
 - SBCL/X11

Usage: see test.lisp


Todo:
- fullscreen mode
- key repeat
- sdl:with-events like helper macro
- OSX (X11 version should work)
